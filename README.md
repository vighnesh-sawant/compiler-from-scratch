# compiler-from-scratch
Trying to learn how compilers work!

Trying this out, either get the binary from the releases tab or   
clone the repo and run cargo build --release ( you should have cargo installed) you'll find the binary in target/release/.

You can try checking out the write_a_c_compiler/stage_3/valid folder it has some example c programs that my compiler can compile!
I have not yet implemented a lot of c functionality tho!
